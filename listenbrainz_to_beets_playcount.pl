# A Messy and Dirty script to import playcounts from listenbrainz
# into beets.  I try and run this script a couple of times a year
# I don't need up-to-date counts, just an idea of what I've liked
# over the years and what might be good to check out, which this
# does.

# Get your data from https://listenbrainz.org/profile/export/
# Click on Download Listens.  Drop file in current
# directory, change filename below to match.

# Run the script.  It'll create a new file named `output.beets`.
# run it with `sh output.beets`.  It'll take a LONG TIME.

# When your done, delete the json file and output.beets

# - Known Bugs ----------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Dupes when songs have words with a ' or a â€™ - same with ... (or utf char 
#    for the same)  even have a few tracks with same name but no apostrophe
#     fix: figure out it's a dupe, add both counts together, submit two times to
#     beets? how to match dupes?
# 2. beet import process is super slow.  Maybe open library and
#    update with sqllite queries?
# 3. Need to store timestamp of last run.  Only produce new beets commands
#    for updated tracks
